# miRò
> a miRNA knowledge base



### Description:
miRo' is a web-based knowledge base that provides users with miRNA–phenotype associations in humans. It integrates data from various online sources, such as databases of miRNAs, ontologies, diseases and targets, into a unified database equipped with an intuitive and flexible query interface and data mining facilities. The main goal of miRo' is the establishment of a knowledge base which allows non-trivial analysis through sophisticated mining techniques and the introduction of a new layer of associations between genes and phenotypes inferred based on miRNAs annotations. Furthermore, a specificity function applied to validated data highlights the most significant associations.
